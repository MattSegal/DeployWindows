https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/publishing/iis.html
includes installing .net core 1.00 windows server hosting

- install the core thingy for iis
- setup new app pool with 'no managed code'
- make website root path point to web (remove web)

===== Deployment Workflow =====

Do windows updates (at some point)

Run first bootstrap script (bootstrap_deploy_1.ps1)

	* Set ExecutionPolicy to Bypass
	* Install Chocolately
	* Install .NET 4.5 via choco
	* Install Powershell and WMF 5 via choco
	* Reboot box

Run second bootstrap script (bootstrap_deploy_2.ps1)

	* Install PackageManager (for Install-Module)
	* Install DSC Packages
		- xWebAdministration
	* Install utilities
		- git
		- python2
	* Enable convenience features
		- Set windows explorer options
		- Install sublime text 3
		- Install google chrome
	* Pull deployment scripts from GitHub
	* Reboot box

// do the following in any order

Run Powershell DSC (configure_deployment.ps1)
	* Set up Windows Features
		- DotNet 3.5
		- DotNet 4.5
	* Set up IIS
		- Enable IIS
		- Enable ASP.NET 4.5
		- Add the app pool
		* Add the website
		* Add the applications

Inject Profile (set_profile.ps1)

Pull Build (pull_build.ps1)
	* get code from GitHub, pull into IIS website folder

===============================

Other things we could do
	* setup PSModulePath to find modules

Tricks?
	* . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot MyScript.ps1)
	* configure notes with configurationData = @{ AllNodes = @() }
	* compile the DSC on the box? (project_environment.ps1)

Deploying the build?
	* build code to a separate folder (MSBuild)
	* nominally run tests
	* save build version to git repo
	* move the code to server
	* do whatever needs to be done on the server
